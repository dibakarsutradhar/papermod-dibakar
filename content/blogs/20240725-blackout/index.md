The last couple of days especially since 16th July, i have been anxious. My anxiety went through the roof on 18th July when we experienced government directed nationwide internet shutdown to cover up all the mass killings of the protesting students and civilians by the Government, their activist terrorist groups called Chatro League and the allied military forces and it continued for the next 6 days until 24th July.

We lost at least 200+ young bright students and thousands have been injured by the bullets, tear-shells, grenades. It was pen and paper against the bullets. https://shohid.info is keeping track of the people we lost during the mass killing, people who gave their life for asking for their right in a so called republic country.

During this dark days, I kept on calling and texting my friends on various locations to source some news as the local news channels started to act like nothing was happening inside Bangladesh. All sort of international calls and messages were blocked. I was anxious about my work commitment as I work remotely, and I could not keep my commitment for at least 6 days.

I would like to thank all the telecommunication services, who increased their service charges like talk time charge per minute, sms charges at least by 30%-40% during this crisis. You guys are proper capitalist. 

I will probably write more regarding this, especially since the blackout, i had lots of thoughts circulating around my head. I will try to convert them into some sort of articles.

Thanks to everyone who have been reaching out to me regarding me and my families safety. We are fine physically, however, my country and its peoples are not.
