<summary><strong>Backend Software Engineer</strong></summary>

I have been writing scalable softwares for roughly 3.5 years with experience in _blockchain_, _decentralized applications_, _serverless_, _monolithic_ and _microservices_. I specialize in **JavaScript** and **Nodejs**, but I donâ€™t shy away from other languages to solve problems.

<summary><strong>Web3 Security Researcher</strong></summary>

I have been a security enthusiast for a while, and I recently started to solo audit various DeFi protocols as a project to create a safer web3 space under the alias of **[Chainrunner](https://twitter.com/chainrunnersec)**.

<summary><strong>Open-Source Enthusiast & Product Maker</strong></summary>

I love making products, and I see it as the highest pursuit of my career. Over the years, I've independently built many products, either for companies or as open-source projects.

Along with my friend, we released one of the most prominent open-source projects based in Bangladesh, [DevSonket](https://www.devsonket.com), which aims to serve thousands of Bengali software engineers by providing them with necessary engineering quick notes.
